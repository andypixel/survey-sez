# To do

- RESULTS screen should not display answers to all players--Announcer should read these aloud (more engaging). The Continue button should go through two steps. The first shows all entries, the second starts the next round.
- Onboarding phase is not updating in real time as teams are created
- Summary screen; start new round (allow users to add more categories but also reuse unused categories from last round)
- Provision database for production build
- Hosting
- Design refinements
- Advanced state management (i.e. across sessions)
