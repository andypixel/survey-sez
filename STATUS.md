# To do

- Onboarding phase is not updating in real time as teams are created
- Game restart
    - Unused custom categories can be reused in this room
    - ALL custom categories can be reused if the user joins a different room
- Team summary component during gameplay: team names, player names, number of custom categories each
- Provision database for production build
- Hosting
- What if someone drops while they are the announcer, or the announcer role moves to them but they are not online?
    - "Skip this announcer" button?
    - What other cases might cause the game to stall?
- Design refinements
- Advanced state management (i.e. across sessions)
- Prevent duplicate entries for custom categories
