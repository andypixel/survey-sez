# To do

- Onboarding phase is not updating in real time as teams are created
- Game End screen; start new round (allow users to add more categories but also reuse unused categories from last round)
- Provision database for production build
- Hosting
- What if someone drops while they are the announcer, or the announcer role moves to them but they are not online?
    - "Skip this announcer" button?
    - What other cases might cause the game to stall?
- Design refinements
- Advanced state management (i.e. across sessions)
- Prevent duplicate entries for custom categories
